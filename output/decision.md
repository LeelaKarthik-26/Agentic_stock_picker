Chosen Company:
- **Company:** Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
- **Rationale:** AMD has formed a strategic partnership with OpenAI to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of their GPUs, which is expected to significantly boost revenues by over $2 billion in the next year. This places AMD in a strong position within the rapidly growing AI sector, allowing them to compete effectively against giants like Nvidia.

Not Selected Companies:
1. **Google (GOOGL)**
   - **Reason for Not Selection:** Despite Google's advancements with their new AI chips, the immediate financial impact and revenue boost are not as clearly defined as AMD's forecasted revenue growth through their partnership with OpenAI. Google's position in the AI market remains strong but not as compelling for immediate investment impact.
   
2. **Anthropic (Not publicly traded)**
   - **Reason for Not Selection:** Although Anthropic's deal with Google Cloud is significant, they are not publicly traded, limiting direct investment opportunities. Additionally, the financial impact in terms of revenues and growth projections does not match that of AMD's partnership with OpenAI.
